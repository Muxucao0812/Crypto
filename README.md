# HF-NTT: Hazard-Free Dataflow Accelerator for Number Theoretic Transform

## Introduce
HF-NTT is a hazard-free dataflow accelerator implementation designed for Number Theoretic Transform (NTT). This project aims to enhance NTT computation performance through efficient hardware acceleration, which is commonly used in homomorphic encryption, post-quantum cryptography, and other cryptographic applications.
